### Array vs Slices

Arrays are fixed-length sequences of items of the same type. Arrays in Go can be created using the following syntaxes:
```
[N]Type
[N]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
[...]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
```
Unlike in C/C++ (where arrays act like pointers) and Java (where arrays are object references), arrays in Go are values. This has a couple of important implications: (1) assigning one array to another copies all of the elements, and (2) if you pass an array to a function, it will receive a copy of the array (not a pointer or reference to it).

As you might imagine, this can be very expensive, especially when you are working with arrays that have a large number of elements.

Slices, on the other hand, are much more flexible, powerful, and convenient than arrays. Unlike arrays, slices can be resized using the built-in append function. Further, slices are reference types, meaning that they are cheap to assign and can be passed to other functions without having to create a new copy of its underlying array. Lastly, the functions in Goâ€™s standard library all use slices rather than arrays in their public APIs.

Slices can be created using the following syntaxes:
```
make([]Type, length, capacity)
make([]Type, length)
[]Type{}
[]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
```
Overall, slices are cleaner, more flexible, and less bug-prone than arrays, so you should prefer using them over arrays whenever possible.
